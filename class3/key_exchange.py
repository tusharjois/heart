# Alice: generate a secret a and public A

# Bob: generate a secret b and public B

# Alice: send public A -> Bob

# Bob: receive public A from Alice, 
#      compute the shared secret K using A and b, and
#      send public B -> Alice

# Alice: receive public B from Bob, and
#        compute the shared secret K using B and a

# Alice and Bob now have the same shared secret, K!
